Bungalow presents us with imaginative and novel music, carving their unique and beautiful path through exotic jazz and rhythms on their third album "Unseen Scenes" from 2015.

Compulsively rhythmic and compelling.... is another fantastical journey through the nooks and crannys of modern jazz with exotic fringes.

1. dancing elephant - tribal, ethnic folk with modern jazz and grand flourishes from all, esp piano . unique songwriting sense and sounds

2. gauge - uptempo, straight-ahead type of modern jazz, exciting and fun and pleasurably listenable "what will they come up with" / "what will they do next?" compels curiosity as you tap your feet

3. its not a sad song - slow and contemplative, meditative soothing

4. march in the labyrinth - groovy, tangible, mysterious, rocking, argentine rhythms

5. Astir - magical, free, soundscape, 2nd half turns into typical Kato-sound modern European jazz piano riff, heavy rocking deep sounds with slow brooding emotion

6. bombay duck - a live favorite, comfortable Indian tabla drums atmosphere, pleasant and joyful

7. space turtle - fun quick melancholic tone yet energetic and exciting

8. absence - sax solo opening, then normal bungalow song

9. respective scene - experimental sound effects, an attempt to create new type of music which had not been attempted before, bass/drum 2-note vamp with electronic robot sounds, knocking, static, scratching, whirring gears, beeps, and finally piano joining in with two-chord harmony vamp, then sax joining in on spacey melody

On *You Already Know* (2017), the fourth album from this imaginative Japanese group, Bungalow does what they do best in modern, creative jazz, as well as incorporating new ideas and sounds into the mix. Rich with ideas and catchy music, this album is full of original songs incorporating elements of jazz, free jazz, Indian tabla drums, and electronic sound effects. *You Already Know *is the latest in a series of successful conceptual releases of experimental and adventurous modern jazz with strong hooks and compelling rhythms.

The jazz group <strong>Bungalow</strong> displays their original approach to modern art jazz on their second album, *Past Life*, from 2013. As a jazz quartet featuring an airy alto sax and piano, double bass, and drums, the group incorporates creative musical elements such as the use of Indian tabla drums and subtle sound effects and processing, a bit similar to the style of the Swedish jazz group E.S.T.

Bungalow's compositions are in focus here, and like modern songwriting from Wayne Shorter, the music differs from standard jazz patterns with interesting, well-constructed songs, featuring elements of upbeat swing, poetic and meditative calm, visceral rock and organically looping riffs, embellished with searching melodies and smart improvisation played brilliantly. This is well-balanced and addictive modern jazz which weaves deep musical grooves with imaginative compositions and skillful playing, reflecting future-facing sounds built on traditional music from *Past Life*.
