warm tones of electric guitar and electric bass

The breathy tone of the long tenor sax, pushing air through with a heavy sadness or nostalgia or...

the deep round anchor of the bass which is necessary, comforting in some of these places where

interesting use of self-reference to songs: last song (1st), encore (5th), and epilogue (last, 9th) which is actually the 1st track redone.

with somewhat longer than radio-play lengths (7, 8, 9, 10 minutes) to allow the songwriting and statements to build slowly and confidently with space to stretch and unfold at their own pace, like tentacles from the deep powerfully entwining you and dragging you down.

A quality of Hashizume's music, things done subtly but powerfully, melodic qualities changing under your feet like shifting sand, or rhythms engineered to be atypical but solid.

1. Last Song - <strong>freeish mid/slow 4/4?</strong>  abstract painting of sound, sax and guitar duet on head melody while bass drums and piano rhythm section paint a dreamy landscape underneath. fluid, floating, swirling like liquid and vapor smoothly merging into and out of abstract shapes but with a strong melody statement by the tenor sax which pulls the mist and rhythm around in its wake. Sticks in head as a recollection of a mysterious dream.
2. 桜雨 (Sakura-Ame) - <strong>slow/</strong><strong>midtempo 3/4</strong> - slightly odd off-kilter funny feeling waltz, dark, mysterious like the rain it references. same dreamy misty feeling, a slightly wobbly/drunk waltz. solos: sax and guitar
3. Sign - <strong>mid/uptempo 5/4</strong> - <strong>one of the highlights as far as energy/stimulation </strong>- cool breeze exciting stylish jazz drama, rock sensibilities with crisp drums and simple, memorable theme over progressively exciting underlying chords/harmonic movement. FENDER RHODES solos: guitar, sax, drums over brief vamp, a simple sax loop as things wind down/heat up ending.  <strong>drums impressive throughout</strong>
4. Fraise - <strong>slow tender 4/4 with slow rock? pulse</strong> <strong>- one of the highlights for songs you want to hear again - </strong>rock ballad, catchy melody, shifting and curious/unfamiliar yet familiar - FENDER RHODES - solos: guitar, fender rhodes, sax (on outro)
5. Encore - <strong>up/mid tempo 4/4 rock/jazz beat</strong> <strong>highlight for one of the most engaging/exciting</strong> -  for opening, bass plays theme over piano arpeggios - exciting solos: bass,  piano (best on album? with alternating, competing RH and LH scene-stealing), sax and guitar simultaneous improv
6. Keep in Mind - <strong>free, slow, no meter/pulse turning into slow 3/4 waltz, unwinds halfway through into piano solo,  - highlighted as one of the most "song like" tunes for this part only? highlight for the most exploratory, dream-like, story-telling, developing like a 3-part drama? composed vs. free sections with extra space for piano solo improv spotlight - </strong>like an unwinding poem. slow and developing. turning into a laksidaisikal waltz heavy with blooming emotion. winding down midway through to explore group free styling. some interesting free and sound effects. solos: piano (short interlude), sax (lets loose with vibrant crescendo/boiling water), piano improv (solo like a keith jarrett style solo piano adlib) with light sound effects and noises
7. Structure - <strong>midtempo 7/4</strong> - cool stylish mood over bass drones, FENDER RHODES giving it the feel of one style of the vintage chick corea (vintage futuristic feel?). fractured intelligent melody statement (sax and guitar in unison) of fresh, cool stylish chords (subtly changing tonal qualities) underlying bass riff and drums. carries you away on it's cool plane of surface-skimming spaceship glider, solos: sax, keyboard
8. Friends - <strong>slow ballad highlight for most pretty, song-like, innocent tune, freely played slow with subtle meter </strong>- with a pretty plaintive, yearning, pleading, quietly playful(?) quality. very song-like. solos: sax (theme statement?), guitar, piano, sax (theme?)
9. Epilogue - <strong>mid/free swirly 4/4</strong> -  a retelling of the 1st track "Last Song" (get it?). A bookend and callback. one of the greats (was this song repeated on another album?) slow, exploratory and a great unforgettable melody over swirling chords like abstract clouds shifting and changing in the soft invisible currents in the sky
