Like a warm ocean wave flowing over your mind, ...lifing you with immense power and unmooring your body from the earth, connecting it to the movements and pulsing of something greater. expert at creating a mood, push and pull, tension and release of musical movements. Like musical literature, with depth and context, compared to flat mass market paperback time-fillers.

<ol>
 	<li>current - slow breathing open, setting up acoustic scene warmly, slowly, comfortably - sx/ds/gtr/eb</li>
 	<li>last moon nearly full - rock/pop style jazz, emotionally charged</li>
 	<li>conversations with Moore - sim #2, pop song-ish, but atmospheric, dramatic, harmonically &amp; thematically interesting as marked in Hashizume's typically interesting, if a bit complex, compositional style, developing slowly and rising to brimming/boiling/overflowing climaxes/peaks</li>
 	<li>the last day of summer - exciting and dramatic, interplay/conversation between the 4 members is captivating and brilliant, with union lines at times, back-and-forth call-and-response at other times, each member taking a large role in shaping the surface of this soundscape, with peaks and valleys, racing through the desert contours like shapeshifting lifeforms flying through the air right above the surface. with built-in cliffhanger-type section which thrills the listener with suspenseful breaks, twirling spiralling melodic unison lines.</li>
 	<li>十五夜　じゅうごや - n<span class="meaning-meaning">ight of the full moon; the night of the 15th day of the 8th lunar month - slow atmosphere-building ballad, sounds, free space (no steady beat or pulse). meditative, sound-ful music which may help for bringing forth unconscious images, scenes, and a deep sense of mindfulness perhaps?
</span></li>
 	<li>slumber - like 2, 3, a riff-based loop over which 1 or 2 of the instruments play a winding melody line in beautiful contrast. this time, gtr plays loop riff, sax and electric bass unison on melody, which drums set up a exciting pulse with a maturity of patience and development.</li>
 	<li>the color of silence - soundscape, free, building colors of audio together</li>
 	<li>journey - *a highlight* starting with quick drum pattern but layered over with slow, ballad style piano/sax/bs/gtr, setting up a mysterious contrasting unsettling feeling of anticipation</li>
 	<li>home - shorter ballad style free-ish jazz soundscape, gentle easing out</li>
</ol>
