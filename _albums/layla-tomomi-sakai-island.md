Easy and breezy, as if dozing in a hammock between palm trees, Layla Tomomi Sakai's *The Island* stirs up visions of vacationing and relaxing in sultry lands as music floats softly by.

Sakai's deep voice embraces the listener, dancing lightly through bossa novas and Latin-tinged music. The music is comforting, the musicians performing pieces that come and go in an uncomplicated manner, lulling the listener into a state of reassuring comfort. Sakai uses her voice gently yet confidently, producing an effect of sweet directness with an affectionate touch.

Several songs feature Sakai singing simply with a guitar and one other instrument: Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Desafinado" and "Once I Loved", as well as "Negaeri", a ballad sung in Japanese as a gentle album closer.

While maintaining the calm atmosphere, three songs also feature Sakai singing with a jazz quintet: "Only Trust Your Heart", "I Remember You", and "The Island" all feature piano, guitar, horn, bass, and drums, coming together to create a wonderfully pleasant sound, like an island breeze drifting softly by.
