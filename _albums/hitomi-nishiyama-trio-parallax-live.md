This 2016 album simply entitled *Live* from Hitomi Nishiyama's Parallax piano trio marks 10 years since her label debut *Cubium* in 2006. With various projects and albums released under her name, this is the third release for her Parallax group, an edgier, groovier, and rhythmically-energized jazz piano trio.

Recorded live over two nights at the Creole jazz bar in Kobe, the eight songs feature her original compositions plus a rearranged "My Favorite Things", with a new pulse and layers added to the popular standard.

As always, Nishiyama’s music is graced with a flowing elegance and creativity, displaying elements of European jazz with a searching, driving melodic sense. The listener is treated to odd time signatures, up-tempo jazz, elegiac ballads, some soul and rock structures, all framed in an in-the-moment live jazz setting.

As complex as the compositions may be, the recorded-live aspect brings tangible energy with a raw edge to the extended songs, and also shines a spotlight on the trio’s cohesiveness and ability to respond to each other in the moment, making music as a unit, three minds in parallel.
