<a href="http://www.jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/L1200748.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3724 alignright" src="http://www.jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/L1200748-300x281.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" /></a>Music that takes you places, <strong>Visible/Invisible</strong> from the Ryosuke Hashizume Group presents six works of art from the saxophonist/composer, perfectly executed by the five musicians, through mellow, warm electric guitar, grooving and smooth electric fretless bass, organic and emotive piano, thrillingly creative drumming, and center-stage visceral tenor sax, filling out the spaces of otherworldly jazz.

<a href="http://www.jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/L1200752.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3725 alignright" src="http://www.jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/L1200752-300x284.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="284" /></a>Through sounds ranging from ethereal and delicate to deep and groovy, the music steadily develops in dramatic style, patiently, with nooks and crannies of musical texture creating a fulfilling, lush experience. This is art music, creative jazz with rock, modern classical, and free elements, carefully crafted with space for the skilled musicians to stretch out together, painting fantastic and vivid colors with harmonic richness and rhythmic dynamicism.
