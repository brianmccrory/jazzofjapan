<a href="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/L1220679.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4513 alignright" src="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/L1220679-300x288.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="288" /></a>Expressing an exuberance for life with an original jazz spirit, *Life is too Great* from the Sayaka Kishi Trio is a vivid recording, full of variety and infused with the pure music spirit of Sayaka Kishi.

Active in many groups and collaborations, Kishi returns to the classic piano trio form on *Life is too Great* and leads a powerhouse jazz trio, showcasing talent and songwriting with new original tunes, with the ever-hardy, invigorating Ryoji Orihara on fretless bass and crisp rhythmic master Akira Yamada on drums.

<a href="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/L1220687.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4514 alignright" src="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/L1220687-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" /></a>From the swinging modern-jazz opener "DON PAPA", the trio sparks a fire, and with such variety on the album highlights abound: the smooth fusion groove "Kin No Doto", the darkly dramatic and tense "Madoka", and the snappy up-beat samba "Palette" are all addictively ear-catching tunes. In addition, the album includes cleverly-arranged jazz on "I Have A Dream", <a href="http://jjazzist.com/album/sayaketts-colors/">Sayaketts</a>-style funky pop jazz on "Trip! or Tweet?", and honestly sweet ballads on "Life is too Great" and "Dai Ni No Furosato", a great album-closer full of emotion and charm.

<a href="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/L1220697.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4517 alignright" src="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/L1220697-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>In addition to her eight original offerings, three cover songs are included: Chick Corea's "La Fiesta", Thelonious Monk's "Evidence", and the jazz standard "Guilty", performed as a dreamy piano solo.

On *Life is too Great*, Kishi's tunes and performances are great and full of life, prismatic and memorable, befitting this polished modern jazz trio.
