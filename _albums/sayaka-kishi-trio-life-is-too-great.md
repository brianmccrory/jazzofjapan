Expressing an exuberance for life with an original jazz spirit, *Life Is Too Great* from the Sayaka Kishi Trio is a vivid recording, full of variety and infused with the pure music spirit of Sayaka Kishi.

Active in many groups and collaborations, Kishi returns to the classic piano trio form on *Life Is Too Great* and leads a powerhouse jazz trio, showcasing talent and songwriting with new original tunes, with the ever-hardy, invigorating Ryoji Orihara on fretless bass and crisp rhythmic master Akira Yamada on drums.

From the swinging modern-jazz opener "DON PAPA", the trio sparks a fire, and with such variety on the album highlights abound: the smooth fusion groove "Kin No Doto", the darkly dramatic and tense "Madoka", and the snappy up-beat samba "Palette" are all addictively ear-catching tunes. In addition, the album includes cleverly-arranged jazz on "I Have A Dream", Sayaketts-style funky pop jazz on "Trip! or Tweet?", and honestly sweet ballads on "Life Is Too Great" and "Dai Ni No Furosato", a great album-closer full of emotion and charm.

In addition to her eight original offerings, three cover songs are included: Chick Corea's "La Fiesta", Thelonious Monk's "Evidence", and the jazz standard "Guilty", performed as a dreamy piano solo.

On *Life Is Too Great*, Kishi's tunes and performances are great and full of life, prismatic and memorable, befitting this polished modern jazz trio.
