Vibist Kaori Nakajima returns with her second album *Cross Point* featuring KVQ: Kaori Vibes Quartet (formerly Vangy!!), a jubilant combo with jazz vibraphone springing out mellow tones at the center.

Starting with the high-energy "Cross Point", the quartet explores directions from straight-ahead jazz and relaxed swing to quiet ballads and Spanish-tinged rubato. With skilled playing and engaging compositions, highlights include the pop-catchy "Dandelion", the edgy "Flicker", a nod to Horace Silver and Cedar Walton on "Golden Pine", and the soft atmospheric reverb of "Moonlights Underwater", summoning undulating waves in the comfort of twilight.
