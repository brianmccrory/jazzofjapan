*Niwatazumi* (a large puddle remaining after heavy rainfall) is a wonderful modern jazz record from Kazumi Ikenaga + PAUSELAND. Spacey original compositions and mature musicianship flow in the breathy and open style of a modern ECM recording. Relaxing and anthemic, the music is at times mesmerizing and at other times gently rocking and grooving.
