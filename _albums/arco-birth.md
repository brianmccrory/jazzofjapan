<a href="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L1220699.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5658 alignright" src="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L1220699-300x271.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="271" /></a>The piano and cello duo Arco released their second album *Birth* in 2019, two years after their debut *Asymmetry*, showing grace and refinement in a matured and eternally sunny outlook.

Opening with overdubbed cello playing a classical Bach theme, the duo kicks into their otherwise all-original songs featuring their airy style vibrating with positivity and passion. The duo is practiced at producing heady pop with classical influences and a definite pulse. Kishi and Sano’s originals are satisfyingly balanced, with moods shifting like wind through the trees with endearing waltzes, fiery Latin movements, and beautifully poignant and sweet melodies. Although the duo focuses on piano and cello arrangements, some minimal additions of percussion clappers and melodion keyboard add spice to enhance the pure music experience.
