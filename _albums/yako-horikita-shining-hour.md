Fans of vintage vocal jazz will be drawn to singer Yako Horikita's debut album *Shining Hour*, a swinging collection of twelve jazz standards delivered with a shining, sparking sincerity.

Singing along with a piano trio plus saxophone, Horikita picks winners from the classic jazz songbook with tunes including "Nice Work If You Can Get It", "Falling In Love With Love", and "Under A Blanket Of Blue". Horikita's voice, a pleasant mix of deep huskiness with a light delicate touch, is confident, friendly, and warm, fitting perfectly with her jazz combo's solid performance.

While most of the tracks are straightforward mid-tempo swingers, a few of tunes offer variations with bossa and ballads on "When Sunny Gets Blue", "Second Love", and the album closer, a sweetly nostalgic "Over The Rainbow".
