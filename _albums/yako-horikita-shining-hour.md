<a href="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/L1220614.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4687 alignright" src="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/L1220614-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Fans of vintage vocal jazz will be drawn to singer Yako Horikita's debut album *Shining Hour*, a swinging collection of twelve jazz standards delivered with a shining, sparking sincerity.

Singing along with a piano trio plus saxophone, Horikita picks winners from the classic jazz songbook with tunes including "Nice Work If You Can Get It", "Falling In Love With Love", and "Under A Blanket Of Blue". Horikita's voice, a pleasant mix of deep huskiness with a light delicate touch, is confident, friendly, and warm, fitting perfectly with her jazz combo's solid performance.
