Seiji "Taddy" Tada cooks with bebop, blues, and ballads on *Workout!!* from 2018. This album, his 13th as leader, is a dream come true for the musician, as he recorded with stellar American jazz musicians whom he had previously toured with, famed jazz drummer Lewis Nash and his trio. No doubt these players, all worthy idols of Tada's, provided extra inspiration for the high-caliber and exciting playing on this recording.

<a href="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/L1220627.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4900 alignright" src="http://jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/L1220627-300x291.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="291" /></a>
This album was recorded with Tada and Lewis Nash's trio over a busy two days in New York, and although beset with some obstacles at first (resulting in drummer Kenny Washington subbing for Nash on the recording), the jazz spirit pushes through on sizzling versions of jazz standards and Tada's originals. Right out of the gate, attention-grabbing bebop fills the grooves, particularly on Tada's uptempo tunes "Workout", "Black Rock", and Charlie Parker's "Segment". The slick alto playing of Sonny Stitt comes to mind with a similar boiling energy and fluid improvisational flights. It's not all bebop mania however, with lovely sentimental playing on "O Grande Amor" and "Autumn In New York", giving the leader a chance to shine on his beloved flute and alto flute instruments.

Whether Japanese or American, in New York or Tokyo, the "This is Jazz!" spirit offers a fulfilling *Workout!!* here over eight tracks and a 50-minute playing time.
