Pianist Mayuko Katakura’s 2009 debut album *Inspiration* immediately impresses. The album kicks off at a rapid pace with "Blues For Tyner", a tribute to one of her jazz inspirations pianist McCoy Tyner. Right from this fierce opening, Katakura’s amazing technique is on full display with angular, acrobatic lines flying through this up-tempo tune.

In addition to speed, Katakura’s confident jazz piano sense extends to bluesy grooves and touching sensitivity. This is a pianist who plays with a dedication to the music and to those she has been inspired by. The ten tracks on *Inspiration*, with originals and nicely-arranged standards, make this a well-balanced set with a variety of tempos and moods.
