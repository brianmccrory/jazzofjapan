Pianist/composer Koichi Sato releases his latest album with a distinctive sextet, clarinet and guitar adding modern groundedness, cello providing graceful maturity.

The main theme was conceived while traveling in Norway and viewing a certain painting: Art Rolfsen's "The Big Station", which graces the cover and inspired "The Railway Station" four-part suite, distinct songs with common echoes.

From this blossom beautiful songs of travel scenes. Intelligent, dramatic compositions and full, earthy sounds create moods including exciting, relaxing, hectic, impressionistic, and, naturally, melancholic - emotions arising at different times during a long journey: a soundtrack to a trip, a modern work of art.
