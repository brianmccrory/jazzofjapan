The Japanese vocal-guitar duo Meu Coração releases the stunning *A Tempo* as a return to an earlier form. While the duo is well known for playing acoustic Brazilian music at sold-out concert halls and their *Hall Tone* albums, this sixth album presents dramatic variations with an exciting full-band sound.

The album starts with a vibrant "One Note Samba" and also features a catchy "Lawns", the peppy Brazilian tunes "Corrida De Jangada" and "Batacuda Surgiu", and a sentimental, lush "Amazon River". The album closes like a sweet lullaby with a dreamy "Love Me Tender".

The music grooves with creative arrangements and interesting effects, rooted by the vocal-guitar duo at the core who continue to make music from the heart.
