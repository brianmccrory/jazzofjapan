The Japanese vocal-guitar duo Meu Coração releases the stunning *A Tempo* as a return to an earlier form. Well-known for playing acoustic Brazilian music at sold-out concert halls, their sixth album presents dramatic variations with an exciting full-band sound.

Starting with a vibrant "One Note Samba", the album features a catchy "Lawns", peppy Brazilian tunes "Corrida De Jangada" and "Batacuda Surgiu", a sentimental "Amazon River", and a dreamy "Love Me Tender", closing the album like a sweet lullaby.

The music grooves with creative arrangements and interesting effects, rooted by the vocal-guitar duo at the core, making music from the heart.
