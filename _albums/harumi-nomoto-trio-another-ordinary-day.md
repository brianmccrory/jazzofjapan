*Another Ordinary Day* from 2002 is pianist Harumi Nomoto's debut jazz album. Recorded over two summer days in Tokyo, the exciting young pianist runs through eight tunes: five songs with one trio arrangement and two songs with a second trio. Also included among the trio tracks is one solo piece, where Nomoto plays on piano the quiet and affectionate "You Only Know What I Know" by saxophonist Atsushi Ikeda.

On her later albums *Belinda* (2007) and *Virgo* (2014) and at various live shows, Harumi displays talent and affinity for imaginative original compositions not necessarily bound to the standard jazz trademarks. Yet on this first album, Nomoto earns fundamental jazz credit with well-known and swinging jazz standards like "My Shining Hour, "I Didn't Know What Time It Was", and "Stardust".

In addition to these three jazz covers, three originals by Nomoto and two originals by jazz saxophonist Atsushi Ikeda are included. Nomoto’s songs ("Libra Sun", "Blues on Saturday", and "Go-Ma") display early signs of her tendency for addictive grooves and relaxed rhythms, previewing her distinctive talent for imaginative compositions and fresh style.
