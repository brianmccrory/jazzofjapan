A jazz pianist who balances lyricism with boldness, Sachiko Ikuta leads a piano trio on *Haru No Kaze (Spring Wind)* from 2012. Legendary jazz trumpeter Terumasa Hino also joins on two songs, adding an adventurous splash of avant-garde improvisation to the album.

Starting with the title track "Haru No Kaze", the sense of an overture is felt through the light Japanese touches of a sweet melody which turns into the whirling winds of a solid jazz piano trio locking into a tune together. The next track, "Last Tango In Paris", introduces a mood of evocative drama and intrigue with a relaxed beat.

The album's nine songs feature classic jazz standards, songs by Bills Evans and Thelonious Monk, two original compositions, and a charming reconstruction of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" which swings gracefully. Ikuta even puts her well-rounded solo piano on display with a confident rendition of “Everything Happens To Me”, showcasing her dedication to the tradition of great jazz pianists.
