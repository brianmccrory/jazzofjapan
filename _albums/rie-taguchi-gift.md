Vocalist Rie Taguchi leads a swinging sextet on her first full-length album, *The Gift*.

Her sultry voice delivers popular standards such as "I Wish You Love" and "I've Got You Under My Skin", with a cheerful energy hearkening back to Las Vegas showroom jazz. Her charm conveys a sparkling smile, perhaps even a tipsy grin as she sways around the notes gracefully.

The album, featuring delightful arrangements by Seiji Endo along with Taguchi’s pop-oriented originals, starts at full swing but closes calmly with a warm "Close to You", followed by Taguchi quietly singing and playing piano on her song "Voices".
