Pianist Sayaki Kishi and cellist Mayumi Sano released their first album together under the moniker Arco with *Asymmetry* in 2017. The pair’s music consists of original songs with a single Bach composition, all played in lovely and skillful arrangements. With more than a slight touch of classical elegance, the music spans various moods with verve: upbeat, fresh, somber, and refined. Although it may be apt to call this music classical-pop or pop-classical rather than typical jazz, the improvisational spirit and composed musicianship are definitely on display and quite enjoyable.
