The piano and cello duo Arco released their first album *Asymmetry* in 2017. The music consists of all originals with a single Bach composition, all played in lovely arrangements with verve and skill. With more than a slight touch of classical elegance, the music spans various moods: upbeat, fresh, somber, and refined. Although it may be apt to call this music classical-pop or pop-classical rather than typical jazz, the improvisational spirit and composed musicianship are definitely on display and quite enjoyable.
