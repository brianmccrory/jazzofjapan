Bungalow presents us with imaginative and novel music, carving their unique and beautiful path through exotic jazz and rhythms on their third album "Unseen Scenes" from 2015.

Compulsively rhythmic and compelling.... is another fantastical journey through the nooks and crannys of modern jazz with exotic fringes.

1. dancing elephant - tribal, ethnic folk with modern jazz and grand flourishes from all, esp piano . unique songwriting sense and sounds

2. gauge - uptempo, straight-ahead type of modern jazz, exciting and fun and pleasurably listenable "what will they come up with" / "what will they do next?" compels curiosity as you tap your feet

3. its not a sad song - slow and contemplative, meditative soothing

4. march in the labyrinth - groovy, tangible, mysterious, rocking, argentine rhythms

5. Astir - magical, free, soundscape, 2nd half turns into typical Kato-sound modern European jazz piano riff, heavy rocking deep sounds with slow brooding emotion

6. bombay duck - a live favorite, comfortable Indian tabla drums atmosphere, pleasant and joyful

7. space turtle - fun quick melancholic tone yet energetic and exciting

8. absence - sax solo opening, then normal bungalow song

9. respective scene - experimental sound effects, an attempt to create new type of music which had not been attempted before, bass/drum 2-note vamp with electronic robot sounds, knocking, static, scratching, whirring gears, beeps, and finally piano joining in with two-chord harmony vamp, then sax joining in on spacey melody
