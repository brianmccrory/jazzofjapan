Inspired by brave, kindhearted students at a benefit concert, musicians Hiroco Nakano, Shinya Nitta, and Seiji Endo created the *Tsutaete Ikou* project to offer support and pay homage to lives taken by the devastating Tohoku earthquake of March 11, 2011.

The resulting heart-warming anthem “Tsutaete Ikou” was dedicated to strengthen the spirit of survivors and help soothe painful memories. The title (meaning to tell, convey) echoes a stone monument at Ishinomaki high school which promises to tell their story forever.

After disasters, one may feel powerless individually, yet the act of remembering, passing the message on, and coming together with music unites us and supports our spirit.

The CD contains three versions of the song, with proceeds donated to affected disaster areas and educational funds for children.

Tracks:

1. Tsutaete Ikou
2. Just Pass It On (English version)
3. Tsutaete Ikou (solo piano version)
