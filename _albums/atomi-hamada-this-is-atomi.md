Jazz singer Atomi Hamada releases *This Is Atomi*, a five-track debut featuring songs she loved as jazz instrumental standards. Here, she adds her voice as an instrument, adding a fresh dimension to songs that some listeners may have often heard as instrumental versions.

This is intimate, close-quarters jazz, with piano and bass backing up the vocals for a soft mellow mood.

In a quiet mood, Hamada starts with a wistful "Round Midnight", a relaxed "Speak No Evil", and a cheery "All The Things You Are", continuing with the catchy "Ladies in Mercedes" and a reconstructed "Confirmation", ending on a bebop high.
