Jazz singer Atomi Hamada releases *This Is Atomi*, a five-track debut featuring songs she has loved as jazz instrumental standards. Here, using her voice as an instrument, she adds a fresh dimension to songs that some listeners may have heard only instrumentally before.

This is intimate, close-quarters jazz, with piano and bass backing up the vocals for a soft mellow mood.

Starting with a quiet dynamic, Hamada sings a wistful "Round Midnight" before moving to a relaxed "Speak No Evil" and a cheery "All The Things You Are". She wraps up the five-track album with a catchy "Ladies in Mercedes" and a reconstructed "Confirmation" to close the set on a bebop high.
