Through jazz, folk, rock, and imagination, the music on *Zephyr* unfurls like smoke rising from fragrant incense, floating and curling in beautiful patterns in the air. A trio consisting of saxophone, acoustic guitar, and electric guitar, the front-forward unit is unbound by genre, producing otherworldly sounds evocative of folk songs from a distant world.

Peaceful, comforting, and deep, the ten tracks feature mostly original music supplied by the members, summoning tranquil and emotional moods. The music is lyrical and poetic, with suggestions of Jan Garbarek, Al Di Meola, Bill Evans and Stan Getz, and even Sting and the Beatles felt among the album's tracks.

Aside from original compositions, the album also features the jazz standard "Sophisticated Lady", the anthemic "Witchi Tai To" (a regular feature of saxophonist Inoue), and a beautiful classically-tinged rendition of Sting's "The Secret Marriage" which, like other parts of the album, evokes a hopelessly romantic scene, music floating on a soft, gentle wind.
