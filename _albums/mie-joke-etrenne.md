Jazz vocalist Mie Joké's 2018 release *Etrenne* is a fun and fancy swing jazz outing, a fresh throwback to classic vocal jazz recordings. Like the best of jazz lover's disks, this collection hits the mark with a great selection of familiar jazz standards performed with a loving touch.

Vocalist Joké purrs atop her jazz group with a confident grace, a breathy tank of soulful emotion and romance. Her solidly swinging jazz combos feature accomplished veteran musicians, with a different group performing for "Side A" and "Side B of the recording as if on a classic jazz vinyl LP.

The music is done right, with an honest, straight-ahead vision, swinging and sliding through jazz standards like "Cheek to Cheek", "Fly Me To The Moon", and "Caravan" with tender authenticity. Aside from jazz, a few bonus pop songs add to the variety with "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" and "Still Crazy After All These Years."
