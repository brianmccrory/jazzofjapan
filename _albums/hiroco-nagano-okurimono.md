*Okurimono* is a two-track CD by the vocalist Hiroco Nagano with pianist Seiji Endo, who take a relaxed approach to the beautiful jazz ballad "Someone To Watch Over Me". Guitarist Shin Umahara joins on the second track, "Okurimono", an original song written by Endo with Japanese lyrics penned by Nagano.

Although there are only two tracks here, the music will serve to whet the appetite and showcase the sweet, sensitive music crafted with love and care.
