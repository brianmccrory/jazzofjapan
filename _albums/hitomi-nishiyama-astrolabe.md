keywords: imaginative, parts of a whole, boundary-pushing, fluid and densely melodic / patterned, dramatic, vividly realized,

playing with dynamics, tonal centers, changing meter structures, and riff-based comp rhythms pinning the duo to sharp-edged angular and floating/racing/swiftly flowing currents of harmony.

Pianist Hitomi Nishiyama makes no secret of her affection towards heavy metal groups from ..., as evidenced by her recent NHORHM trio, which reinvents heavy metal songs through the structure of a jazz piano trio.

From pianist Hitomi Nishiyama and guitarist Takayoshi Baba come a jazz concept album, much like the

Elements of fantasy mixed with classical flourishes and fusion jazz edge-of-your-seat energy.

dream theater esque, malmsteen, like the "concept album" that became popular with certain heavy metal and rock banks like Queensryche and ... in the 1980's, ...

work put into making the suite a complex tapestry of interweaving themes and patterns, telling a story as the plot moves through time changes and harmonic shifts.

suite aspect is how songs blend into each other , movements of a unified piece rather than isolated songs

piano/guitar duo album,with extended suite and extra song(s)

acoustic piano and warm electric guitar

a themed album, with a definite concept... from cover photo to song titles to sound to arrangements

* see liner notes*...
"Astrolabe" Suite:

1. Avaitor - 5-beat (with occasional 6/8 or odd-meter measures) modern jazz with challenging syncopated beats/melody (can be hard to keep your place / track the music if concentration on that - or, just let it flow under you and hang on for the ride), rapid and cool, symphonic(?) mature writing and improv. <strong>advanced and challenging, many parts interlocking together like puzzle pieces</strong>. taking turns, guitar solo, piano solo.

2. Island - mid 4/4 rock ballad type beat, mysteriously shifting harmonies and melody which pulls the flavor out of the beautifully moving harmonic winds. <strong>heavy</strong>. love how the harmonies and chord changes shift and modulate to evoke interest and emotion from the listener as the melody glides over the waves and through the winds. sounds like something a rock/metal band may have written.

3.  Voices in the wind - 7/8? - quick uptempo. tricky. pinned down by beat-driven left hand vamp/bass line. (rereview - ignored parts of this) with harmonic graces and arpeggios like a melding of classical influences (throughout her playing generally) let loose over wild abandon.

4. Underwater - blue in green style (sort of "so many stars"-ish) freeish (free pulse) ballad - like jazz changes and chords filtered through rock edgy sensitibilies with decorated jazz chords and alterations. <strong>interlude/break</strong> between stronger-pulse songs

5 Dancer - mid tempo 3/4 - folk style 5-note scale (pentatonic) melody, abstract and angled and mysteriously nostalgic like a japanese animation movie. with more interplaced odd measures and extensions, arabesque/(term?) for curiously decorated, elaborately designed, eccentric architecure, ...filips?

6 Frontier - opening free time duet playing melody in and out, freely shifting, building together to 5/4 midtempo patient developed into 3/4 and others, with more changes and "cabinet of curiousities", drawers opened and closed, beveled and molded and carved like wood into ... designs. some allusions to future-coming "Shift"/Rock Out style music.

(Extra, non-suite songs):
7 Something I Can Do For You - slow freeish ballad - almost sounds like reference to some themes from the suite.

8 Still Moving... - 3/4 mid tempo - dramatic opening, 6/8 or 3/4 pulse, like bubbles surfacing from underwater with syncopated duo hits and a rhythmic pattern which stimulates and simulates a unpredictably cresting wave or undulating ocean currents, unbalanced and overwhelmingly powerful, alternatingly comfortable and potentially threatening in its embrace.
