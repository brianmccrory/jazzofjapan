Pianists Yukako Yamano and Yukari Inoue make music with two pianos on this mini-album of cheerful exuberance. *Dubai Suite* is a five-part composition by Yukako Yamano and reflects her appreciation and experiences of the exotic locale and recorded in anticipation of a late 2021 return trip. Aside from frequent travels through America, Europe, and Africa, Yamano has also been to Dubai twice, initially in November 2020 then again in December 2021 where she had a chance to sell the just-produced *Dubai Suite*.

Yamano traveled to Dubai in November 2020, her first overseas tour since the pandemic began. Although there were new hurdles like testing, quarantine, cancelations, and a great deal of uncertainty involved, it was a rewarding experience for the pianist, and she found an even deeper appreciation for traveling and sharing music with people around the world. Using these impressions, Yamano created her suite in a burst of inspiration - including her choice of arranging for two pianos which she decided on instinctively. The album was recorded and produced in short order, and she happily brought the end product with her on her second trip to Dubai in December 2021.

> I was finally able to get to Dubai.  The exotic wind after a long absence, the beautiful city of Dubai...  I was very happy to be welcomed by the people.
>
> November 2020 was my first overseas tour since Corona. I was worried, I had to take a PCR test, and it was very different from travel before Corona, but it was a very good experience. After all, I like traveling, I like music, and it's great to be able to live and be together in this way. I'm glad I went. I created a song from my impressions. I made everything intuitively, and I don't know why I decided on two pianos (laughs). 


The album's five tracks add up to a brisk 23 minutes and run a narrative using the descriptive titles "Hope", "Reality", "Run", "Anxiety", and "Victory". The opening track sets up a bright prologue to adventure, and the next two shorter tracks capture the suite's energy with the frolic and whimsey of a chase scene... or perhaps the fun of hurriedly preparing for travel and facing the realities of packing, scheduling, and racing to catch departures. Next, "Anxiety" sets up a slower, contemplative atmosphere while the closing track "Victory" returns to uptempo form with a springy rhythm making for edge-of-your-seat positivity. Like other examples of Yamano's music, the jazz feeling is permeated with a catchy lightness and shine often found in some J-pop styles.
