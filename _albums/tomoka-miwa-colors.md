Popular Tokyo-based singer Tomoka Miwa deploys her jazz palette on this live recording entitled *Colors in Silence* from 2015. Here, she sings standards "I've Got You Under My Skin", "My Favorite Things", and fan favorites "A House Is Not A Home", the classic bolero "Somon Novios", and the groovy samba-funk "Skindo-le-le". Adding to the canvas are a sultry "Love Dance" and a touching rendering of the beautiful hymn "Hallelujah".

The musicians get plenty of space for stretching out, with pianist Yuichi Narita pushing for moments of exploratory post-bop jazz. Each instrumentalist is also featured in duet with vocals, adding colorful variety to the show.
