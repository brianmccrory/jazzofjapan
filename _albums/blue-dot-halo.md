<a href="http://www.jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/L1220113.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3334 alignright" src="http://www.jjazzist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/L1220113-296x300.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="300" /></a>United by a stellar theme of the universe, the Tokyo jazz quartet Blue Dot explores stars and galaxies on their debut album <i>Halo</i> from 2016.

Through ten songs tuned to the mysteries of space and time, the music is solidly modern and positively charged. Tokyo-based drummer Makoto Takeshi leads a quartet consisting of sax, piano, bass, and drums, with original songs supplied by all members of the group.

With strong appeal to the universe theme, Rikitake's "Andromeda" is a gentle, peaceful ode to the wonders of space, while "Echo of Stars" (Tamashi Goto) is a darker, ECM-style mysteriously brooding adventure.

In a memorable closer, the vocalist Maki Fujimura is featured on the last tune "Moon", a sweet song with Japanese lyrics.
