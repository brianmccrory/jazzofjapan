Special Guest Contribution // Press Release
The birth of a world of visual sound!
SOULSTATION will spark your own creative imagination. This trio makes powerful and fascinating music.

Upon Listening to Bassist Minoru Yoshiki’s New Album:

For jazz musicians, the ideal music is the kind where subjective ideas bounce off each other, yet somehow give birth to a harmonious whole. This album brilliantly achieves that ideal.

When the wind blows, trees sway and rustle. When it rains, placid streams become rushing torrents. The natural world is full of such examples of call-and-response. So is the music of this trio, which is just that: a force of nature.

The contrabass provides a canvas upon which the saxophone and piano freely engage in conversation. Together they have painted a highly visual musical world. It was recorded in a public hall in one take, with no going back—conditions that no doubt contributed to the vibrant immediacy of their sound. Listen to it with your imagination running free, and an entire cosmos will appear before your eyes. It will be time well spent.

This trio knows how to make some fascinating music.

Kunihiro Tsuji, Guitarist
