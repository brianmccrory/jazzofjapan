I started by migrating the data (articles and photos), adjusting the layout, and setting up the site framework.

Initially, I decided to include all the articles I sent out in the newsletter in 2021-2022, which means that a lot of new content was added at once to get things started here. 

The following 58 articles were added, which covers all of the relevant newsletter emails. Links to each article are on the [articles]({% link articles.md %}) page.
