**Welcome!**

This is a site with resources for **[J Jazz Substack](https://jjazz.substack.com)**, a newsletter sharing information about Japanese Jazz.

There's not much actual content here, as most of that is found in the individual articles on the main site. 

Related resources are available here by using the menu at the top. 

Audio excerpts are on this [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUDGeoIKVtmk-thXbzNY_jw).
