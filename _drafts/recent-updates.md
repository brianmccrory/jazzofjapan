# Recent Updates: January 2022

* Moved a bunch (30?) of articles from ``jjazz.substack.com`` to this site.
* Developed a method to regenerate the musicians index table from the articles.
* Setup the general tasks like adding the site to google search index, adding a sitemap.xml, feed.xml, updating links, ...

Since a lot of content was moved at once, there may be some issues that I haven't tracked down yet... I hope not, but broken links, typos, or ill-formated pages may pop up here and there. If you contact me about any issues I will address them promptly.

NOTES IN PROGRESS:

what I like about the new format:
- easier to read, to me
- ownership is clear, no extra distractions or messages to signup for anything on substack
- data is structured, so I can do more with it
- any future updates (layout, UI) will be extremely simple

missing:
- no emails go out with each publish (this could also be a good thing)
- no "community" features like comment forums, likes (but this can happen on social media networks or email instead)
- videos are no longer embedded within articles, but available through links

TODO: 
- add a 'featured' pinned post (or post as a new post every month or so)
- get feedback or comments, optional signup for updates
