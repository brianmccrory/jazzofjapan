Sent out to the jjazz.substack.com newsletter on Jan 21, 2022:


> It’s time to enter a new phase of this project, this personal “jazz of Japan” documentation that started four years ago and transformed into this Substack newsletter last year. The next stage of this Japanese Jazz project will continue on jazzofjapan.com, because…
> 
> Substack makes it extremely easy and fun to start writing, send out articles, and gather readers to interesting publications. The company support has been great, and I’m also an avid reader of several other Substack newsletters. And yet…
> 
> I’m come to realize that the content that I want to publish works better as an independent website that I own, rather than a weekly formatted-for-email newsletter managed by a large company. There are several reasons but the overarching theme is about having finer control of how my documents are stored and laid out, and what that allows me to do with the data that makes up my articles (for example, easily updating the musicians index using the raw article data). It’s also just more fun and rewarding this way, to be able to create and publish articles in my own way, which right now is designed to be as simple as possible… the layout and graphics certainly attest to that :).
> 
> Overall, the new site is intended to be more of a selected catalog of Japanese jazz albums with articles and media about them, and less of a date-stamped archive of newsletter emails on substack.com.
> 
> So, I plan to release future articles on jazzofjapan.com. All previous newsletter emails have already been added to jazzofjapan.com, with more updates planned later this month. The focus, for now, is to have a very plain, easy-to-use interface, where the articles are the main content supplemented with album images and links to audio excerpts and videos. No registration or sign-in is required.
> 
> As for this newsletter at jjazz.substack.com, it’s likely that I will shut this down soon, to simplify things and to keep one version of my articles on the new site, rather than duplicating content both here and there. When I do that, I will also remove all remaining subscribers from this newsletter, so you should not get any further emails from jjazz@substack.com (this jjazz@substack.com email address will become inactive so I won’t be able to receive emails there either). In other words, this newsletter will be deleted.
> 
> For those who prefer getting emails rather than checking websites, I am thinking about what to do about that… but initially, there won’t be a newsletter for the new site. I’ll post occasional updates in the “Notes” section of the site which also updates an RSS feed, but that’s about it regarding notifications for now.
> 
> If you have any thoughts or suggestions, you are very welcome to comment here or send a message to me at jazzstudy@gmail.com, or on Twitter @jjazzstack or Instagram @jjazzstack if you prefer.
> 
> Thank you for reading and being a member of this J Jazz Substack! I really appreciate your interest in this humble personal project. And, please visit and bookmark jazzofjapan.com to see what the next phase brings. Until then, またね…
