title: "Thoughts on the new site"

Since a lot of content was moved at once, there may be some issues that I haven't tracked down yet... Problems like broken links, typos, or ill-formated pages may be lurking around the site *(feel free to [contact me]({% link contact.md %}) about any issues and I will address them)*.


What I like about the new site and format:

* the simple layout is easier to read
* no unnecessary distractions or superfluous pages
* the content is structured data, so I can do more with it *(e.g. constructing the Musicians page)*
* future updates should be straightforward and easy
* all content including revisions is backed up

What is different:

* no newsletter emails
* no community features like comments and "likes" *(social networks may be better for that)*
* videos are not embedded in articles but available through links *(eliminates unwanted user tracking and interference with page layout and response time)*
